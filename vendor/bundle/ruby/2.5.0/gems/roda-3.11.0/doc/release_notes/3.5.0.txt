= New Features

* A request_aref plugin has been added for configuring the behavior
  of the [] and []= request methods.  These methods are deprecated
  in the current version of Rack, but Rack will only print a
  deprecation warning in verbose mode.  With this plugin, you can
  choose to never warn, always warn, or raise an exception:

    # Don't emit a warning, allowing for the historical Rack
    # behavior
    plugin :request_aref, :allow

    # Always emit a warning when the method is called
    plugin :request_aref, :warn

    # Raise an exception if the method is called
    plugin :request_aref, :raise

= Other Improvements

* When using the content_for plugin and calling content_for with a
  block, convert the result of the block to a string before passing
  the result to Tilt.  This can fix issues when the template class
  that Tilt uses does not handle non-String input.

* When using the public plugin with the :gzip option, do not add the
  Content-Type or Content-Encoding headers if a 304 response is
  returned.

* Add the spec/views/about directory to the gem, allowing the specs
  to run correctly using just the files in the gem.
