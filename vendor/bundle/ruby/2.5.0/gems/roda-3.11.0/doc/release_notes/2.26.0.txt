= New Features

* The csrf plugin now supports a :skip_middleware option, which adds
  the methods without adding the middleware.  This is designed for
  cases where you are using multiple rack apps, where the rack_csrf
  middleware is loaded in an earlier rack app, and you want to avoid
  the duplicate CSRF checks.

= Other Improvements

* The type_routing plugin now supports using multiple extensions
  where one extension is a suffix of another extension, such as
  using gz and tar.gz.
