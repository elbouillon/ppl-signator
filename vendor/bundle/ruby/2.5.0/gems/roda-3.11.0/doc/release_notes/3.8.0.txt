= New Features

* The convert_each! method in the typecast_params plugin now
  accepts a Proc or Method value for the :keys option. The proc
  or method is called with the current array or hash that
  typecast params is operating on, and should return an
  array of keys to use for the conversion.

* The convert_each! method in the typecast_params plugin will
  now automatically handle hashes with keys from '0'..'N',
  without a :keys option being provided.
  
  This makes it possible to handle parameter names such as
  foo[0][bar], foo[0][baz], foo[1][bar], and foo[1][baz], if you
  want to avoid the issues related to rack's issues when parsing
  array parameters.

= Other Improvements

* The Roda::RodaVersionNumber constant has been added for easier
  version comparisons.  It is 30080 for version 3.8.0.

= Backwards Compatibility

* When an unsupported type is given as value of the :keys option
  to the convert_each! method in the typecast_params plugin, a
  ProgrammerError exception is now raised.
