= New Features

* An error_mail plugin has been added for reporting exceptions raised
  via email.  This is similar to the existing error_email plugin, but
  uses the mail library instead of net/smtp directly.  If you are
  already using the mail library and the error_email plugin in your
  application, it's recommended to switch to the error_mail plugin.
  Example:

    plugin :error_mail, :to=>'to@example.com', :from=>'from@example.com'
    plugin :error_handler do |e|
      error_mail(e)
      'Internal Server Error'
    end
