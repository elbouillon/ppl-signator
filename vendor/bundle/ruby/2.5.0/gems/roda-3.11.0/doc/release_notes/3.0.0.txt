= Major Changes

* String matchers now match literally by default, for simplicity,
  understandability, and performance.  Use the String class matcher
  or a symbol matcher to match arbitrary segments.

    # Before
    r.is "artists/:name" do |artist_name|
    end

    # Now
    r.is "artists", String do |artist_name|
    end
    # or
    r.is "artists", :name do |artist_name|
    end

  You can use the placeholder_string_matchers plugin to restore
  the historical behavior if you don't want to modify your
  routes.

* Using an unsupported matcher now raises an error, making it
  more likely to detect using a unexpected value as a matcher
  (which previously matched everything).

* Have a route/match block return an unsupported value now
  raises an error if nothing has been written to the body, making
  it more likely to detect using an unexpected value as a block
  result (which previously was ignored).

= Backwards Compatibility

* Deprecated plugins, features, and constants have been removed.
  Before upgrading to 3.0.0, please upgrade to 2.29.0 first and
  fix any deprecation warnings.

* Ruby 1.8.7 support has been dropped.  Ruby 1.9.2 is the new
  minimum supported version.

* The :check_paths render plugin option now defaults to true so that
  generated template paths are checked by default, reducing the risk
  of rendering arbitrary files.

* The assets plugin now defaults to using subresource integrity
  with SHA256 for compiled assets, and using SHA256 instead of
  SHA1 for compiled asset hashes.

* Subclassing a Roda app that uses the render plugin now always
  uses a copy of the superclass's template cache.

* Using a Roda app as middleware now always uses a subclass
  of the app for the middleware.

* public_send is now used instead of send internally unless it is
  expected that private methods will be called.

* The match methods added by the symbol_matchers and hash_matchers
  plugins are now private instead of public.

= Other Improvements

* The streaming plugin has been greatly simplified, by dropping
  deprecated compatibility for EventMachine.

* It is now possible to reset the :include_request option to false
  in the json and json_parser plugins by loading the plugin a
  second time with the option set.

* The precompile_templates plugin now always sorts locals.  This
  plugin should now be used with Tilt 2.0.1+ (which also sorts
  locals), though it will still work with earlier Tilt versions.

* The multi_run plugin now recomputes the regexp when freezing the
  app.

= Deprecated Features

These features will be removed in Roda 3.1.0:

* Roda.thread_safe_cache is now deprecated.  RodaCache is now used
  as the thread-safe cache class.

* RodaRequest#placeholder_string_matcher? (private method) is now
  deprecated and always returns false.
