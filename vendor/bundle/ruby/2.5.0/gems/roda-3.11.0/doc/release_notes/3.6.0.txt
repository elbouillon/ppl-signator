= New Features

* An early_hints plugin has been added for senting 103 Early Hint
  responses.  This is currently only supported on puma 3.11+, and
  can allow for improved performance by letting the requestor know
  which related files will be needed by the request.

* An :early_hints option has been added to the assets plugin.  If
  given, calling the assets method will also issue an early hint
  for the related assets.

* A :wrap option has been added to the json_parser plugin.  If set
  to :always, all uploaded json data will be stored using a hash
  with a "_json" key.  If set to :unless_hash, uploaded json data
  will only be wrapped in such a matter if it is not already a hash.

  Using the :wrap option can fix problems when using r.params when
  the uploaded JSON data is an array and not a hash.  However, it
  does change the behavior of r.POST.  It is possible to handle
  uploaded JSON array data without the :wrap option by using r.GET
  and r.POST directly instead of using r.params.
