= New Features

* A status_303 plugin has been added, which changes the default
  redirect status from 302 to 303 if the HTTP version is 1.1 and
  the request is not a GET request.

= Other Improvements

* Roda is now optimized for ruby 2.3+ using frozen string literals
  instead of constant references.  This improves performance on ruby
  2.3+, and decreases performance on ruby <2.3.

= Backwards Compatibility

* Many now unused internal constants are now deprecated, and
  attempting to access them will result in deprecation warnings
  on ruby 2.3+.
