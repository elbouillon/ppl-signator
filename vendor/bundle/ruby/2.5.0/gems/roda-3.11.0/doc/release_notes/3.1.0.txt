= New Features

* A :timestamp_paths option has been added to the assets plugin to
  include timestamps in paths in non-compiled mode.  This can fix
  asset staleness issues when using a caching proxy.  This is
  not needed in compiled mode, as the asset file names include the
  hash of the asset.  It is not the default in non-compiled mode,
  as few people would use a caching proxy in non-compiled mode.

= Other Improvements

* Make set_layout_locals and set_view_locals in branch_locals
  plugin work when the other is not called.

* When testing support for uglifier usability as a JS asset
  compressor, handle case where uglifier is installed but there is
  no available javascript runtime.

= Backwards Compatibility

* The deprecated Roda.thread_safe_cache method has been removed.

* The deprecated private RodaRequest#placeholder_string_matcher?
  method has been removed.
