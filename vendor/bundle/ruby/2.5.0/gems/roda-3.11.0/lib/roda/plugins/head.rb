  module RodaPlugins
    # The head plugin attempts to automatically handle HEAD requests,
    # by treating them as GET requests and returning an empty body
    # without modifying the response status or response headers.
    #
    # So for the following routes,
    #
    #   route do |r|
    #     r.root do
    #       'root'
    #     end
    #
    #     r.get 'a' do
    #       'a'
    #     end
    #
    #     r.is 'b', method: [:get, :post] do
    #       'b'
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # HEAD requests for +/+, +/a+, and +/b+ will all return 200 status
    # with an empty body.
    #
    # This plugin also works with the not_allowed plugin if it is loaded
    # after the not_allowed plugin.  In that case, if GET is one of Allow
    # header options, then HEAD will be as well.
    #
    # NOTE: if you have a public facing website it is recommended that
    # you enable this plugin, or manually handle HEAD anywhere you would
    # handle GET. Search engines and other bots may send a
    # HEAD request prior to crawling a page with a GET request. Without
    # this plugin those HEAD requests will return a 404 status, which
    # may prevent search engines from crawling your website.
