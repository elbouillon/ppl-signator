    # The timestamp_public plugin adds a +timestamp_path+ method for constructing
    # timestamp paths, and a +r.timestamp_public+ routing method to serve static files
    # from a directory (using the public plugin).  This plugin is useful when you want
    # to modify the path to static files when the modify timestamp on the file changes,
    # ensuring that requests for the static file will not be cached.
    #
    # Note that while this plugin will not serve files outside of the public directory,
    # for performance reasons it does not check the path of the file is inside the public
    # directory when getting the modify timestamp.  If the +timestamp_path+ method is
    # called with untrusted input, it is possible for an attacker to get the modify
    # timestamp for any file on the file system.
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    #   # Use public folder as location of files, and static as the path prefix
    #   plugin :timestamp_public
    #
    #   # Use /path/to/app/static as location of files, and public as the path prefix
    #   opts[:root] = '/path/to/app'
    #   plugin :public, root: 'static', prefix: 'public'
    #
    #   # Assuming public is the location of files, and static is the path prefix
    #   r.route do
    #     # Make GET /static/1238099123/images/foo.png look for public/images/foo.png 
    #     r.timestamp_public
    #
    #     r.get "example" do
    #       # "/static/1238099123/images/foo.png"
    #       timestamp_path("images/foo.png")
    #     end
    #   end
    module TimestampPublic
      # Use options given to setup timestamped file serving.  The following option is
      # recognized by the plugin:
      #
      # :prefix :: The prefix for paths, before the timestamp segment
      #
      # The options given are also passed to the public plugin.

        app.plugin :public, opts
